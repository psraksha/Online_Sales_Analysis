# Online_Sales_Analysis

we have the data of a company that deals with computer hardware and peripheral manufacturing and supply them to various stores across India.
They are having problem with tracking the sales and gaining insights in the business. They don't want to deal with the boring data which could be 
very hard to derive insights from. So, I have created a dashboard which includes all the necessary information for the taking calculated decisions.
We have dealth with various measures such as
  1.Revenue
  2.Profit contributions, etc.
